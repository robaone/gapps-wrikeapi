# 2. Documentation will describe the project

Date: 2020-06-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The source code currently exists without context or instructions making it difficult for an outside user to know what to do with it.

## Decision

We will write documentation from the point of view of an outside user so that it will be possible for anyone unfamiliar with the project to put it to good use.

Requirements

1. Describe the purpose of the project.

   It must be clear why this project exists and how it can be used.
   
2. Describe how to install and use.

   It must be clear how to setup hosting of the source code and how to execute it.  The documentation must be clear enough for any developer to follow.
   
3. Make clear the author of the project and how to provide feedback.

   The author of the project must be clearly specified including contact information and how to ask for support and submit updates and feedback.

## Consequences

This project will become useful to anyone interested.
The project will become part of the Github community.
Unknown developers will be able to submit feedback and ask for support.
